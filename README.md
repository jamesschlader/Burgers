# Burgers
This app demonstrates the functionality of handlebars when in the context of MVC architecture and a homebrew ORM. 

User can add burgers to a list ready to eat on their plate, then virtually eat them into their belly, and ultimately delete from the view altogether. The burgers are stored in a simple SQL database until deleted.
